.sp
Condition variables to synchronize between threads\&.
.sp
Condition variables are used when one thread wants to wait until another
thread has finished doing something: the former thread ``waits\&'\&' on the
condition variable, the latter thread ``signals\&'\&' the condition when it
is done\&. Condition variables should always be protected by a mutex\&.
The typical use is (if 
.B D
is a shared data structure, 
.B m
its mutex,
and 
.B c
is a condition variable):
.B 
.B      Mutex\&.lock m;
.B      while (* some predicate P over D is not satisfied *) do
.B        Condition\&.wait c m
.B      done;
.B      (* Modify D *)
.B      if (* the predicate P over D is now satisfied *) then Condition\&.signal c;
.B      Mutex\&.unlock m
.B

The type of condition variables\&.

.sp

.I val create 
: 
.B unit -> t
.sp
Return a new condition variable\&.

.sp

.I val wait 
: 
.B t -> Mutex.t -> unit
.sp

.B wait c m
atomically unlocks the mutex 
.B m
and suspends the
calling process on the condition variable 
.B c
\&. The process will
restart after the condition variable 
.B c
has been signalled\&.
The mutex 
.B m
is locked again before 
.B wait
returns\&.

.sp

.I val signal 
: 
.B t -> unit
.sp

.B signal c
restarts one of the processes waiting on the
condition variable 
.B c
\&.

.sp

.I val broadcast 
: 
.B t -> unit
.sp

.B broadcast c
restarts all processes waiting on the
condition variable 
.B c
\&.
