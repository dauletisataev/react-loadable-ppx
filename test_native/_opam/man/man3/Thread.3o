Lightweight threads\&.

.sp

.sp
.sp
.I type t 

.sp
The type of thread handles\&.

.PP

.I val create 
: 
.B ('a -> 'b) -> 'a -> t
.sp

.B Thread\&.create funct arg
creates a new thread of control,
in which the function application 
.B funct arg
is executed concurrently with the other threads of the program\&.
The application of 
.B Thread\&.create
returns the handle of the newly created thread\&.
The new thread terminates when the application 
.B funct arg
returns, either normally or by raising an uncaught exception\&.
In the latter case, the exception is printed on standard error,
but not propagated back to the parent thread\&. Similarly, the
result of the application 
.B funct arg
is discarded and not
directly accessible to the parent thread\&.

.sp

.I val self 
: 
.B unit -> t
.sp
Return the thread currently executing\&.

.sp

.I val id 
: 
.B t -> int
.sp
Return the identifier of the given thread\&. A thread identifier
is an integer that identifies uniquely the thread\&.
It can be used to build data structures indexed by threads\&.

.sp

.I val exit 
: 
.B unit -> unit
.sp
Terminate prematurely the currently executing thread\&.

.sp

.I val kill 
: 
.B t -> unit
.sp
Terminate prematurely the thread whose handle is given\&.
This functionality is available only with bytecode\-level threads\&.

.B === 
.B Suspending threads

.PP

.I val delay 
: 
.B float -> unit
.sp

.B delay d
suspends the execution of the calling thread for
.B d
seconds\&. The other program threads continue to run during
this time\&.

.sp

.I val join 
: 
.B t -> unit
.sp

.B join th
suspends the execution of the calling thread
until the thread 
.B th
has terminated\&.

.sp

.I val wait_read 
: 
.B Unix.file_descr -> unit
.sp
See 
.B Thread\&.wait_write
\&.

.sp

.I val wait_write 
: 
.B Unix.file_descr -> unit
.sp
Suspend the execution of the calling thread until at least
one character or EOF is available for reading (
.B Thread\&.wait_read
) or
one character can be written without blocking (
.B wait_write
)
on the given Unix file descriptor\&.

.sp

.I val wait_timed_read 
: 
.B Unix.file_descr -> float -> bool
.sp
See 
.B Thread\&.wait_timed_write
\&.

.sp

.I val wait_timed_write 
: 
.B Unix.file_descr -> float -> bool
.sp
Same as 
.B Thread\&.wait_read
and 
.B Thread\&.wait_write
, but wait for at most
the amount of time given as second argument (in seconds)\&.
Return 
.B true
if the file descriptor is ready for input/output
and 
.B false
if the timeout expired\&.

.sp

.I val select 
: 
.B Unix.file_descr list ->
.B   Unix.file_descr list ->
.B   Unix.file_descr list ->
.B   float -> Unix.file_descr list * Unix.file_descr list * Unix.file_descr list
.sp
Suspend the execution of the calling thread until input/output
becomes possible on the given Unix file descriptors\&.
The arguments and results have the same meaning as for
.B Unix\&.select
\&.

.sp

.I val wait_pid 
: 
.B int -> int * Unix.process_status
.sp

.B wait_pid p
suspends the execution of the calling thread
until the Unix process specified by the process identifier 
.B p
terminates\&. A pid 
.B p
of 
.B \-1
means wait for any child\&.
A pid of 
.B 0
means wait for any child in the same process group
as the current process\&. Negative pid arguments represent
process groups\&. Returns the pid of the child caught and
its termination status, as per 
.B Unix\&.wait
\&.

.sp

.I val wait_signal 
: 
.B int list -> int
.sp

.B wait_signal sigs
suspends the execution of the calling thread
until the process receives one of the signals specified in the
list 
.B sigs
\&.  It then returns the number of the signal received\&.
Signal handlers attached to the signals in 
.B sigs
will not
be invoked\&.  Do not call 
.B wait_signal
concurrently
from several threads on the same signals\&.

.sp

.I val yield 
: 
.B unit -> unit
.sp
Re\-schedule the calling thread without suspending it\&.
This function can be used to give scheduling hints,
telling the scheduler that now is a good time to
switch to other threads\&.
