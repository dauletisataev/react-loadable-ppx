.sp
First\-class synchronous communication\&.
.sp
This module implements synchronous inter\-thread communications over
channels\&. As in John Reppy\&'s Concurrent ML system, the communication
events are first\-class values: they can be built and combined
independently before being offered for communication\&.

.sp

.sp
.sp
.I type 
.B 'a
.I channel 

.sp
The type of communication channels carrying values of type 
.B \&'a
\&.

.sp

.I val new_channel 
: 
.B unit -> 'a channel
.sp
Return a new channel\&.

.sp
.I type 
.B +'a
.I event 

.sp
The type of communication events returning a result of type 
.B \&'a
\&.

.sp

.I val send 
: 
.B 'a channel -> 'a -> unit event
.sp

.B send ch v
returns the event consisting in sending the value 
.B v
over the channel 
.B ch
\&. The result value of this event is 
.B ()
\&.

.sp

.I val receive 
: 
.B 'a channel -> 'a event
.sp

.B receive ch
returns the event consisting in receiving a value
from the channel 
.B ch
\&. The result value of this event is the
value received\&.

.sp

.I val always 
: 
.B 'a -> 'a event
.sp

.B always v
returns an event that is always ready for
synchronization\&.  The result value of this event is 
.B v
\&.

.sp

.I val choose 
: 
.B 'a event list -> 'a event
.sp

.B choose evl
returns the event that is the alternative of
all the events in the list 
.B evl
\&.

.sp

.I val wrap 
: 
.B 'a event -> ('a -> 'b) -> 'b event
.sp

.B wrap ev fn
returns the event that performs the same communications
as 
.B ev
, then applies the post\-processing function 
.B fn
on the return value\&.

.sp

.I val wrap_abort 
: 
.B 'a event -> (unit -> unit) -> 'a event
.sp

.B wrap_abort ev fn
returns the event that performs
the same communications as 
.B ev
, but if it is not selected
the function 
.B fn
is called after the synchronization\&.

.sp

.I val guard 
: 
.B (unit -> 'a event) -> 'a event
.sp

.B guard fn
returns the event that, when synchronized, computes
.B fn()
and behaves as the resulting event\&. This allows events with
side\-effects to be computed at the time of the synchronization
operation\&.

.sp

.I val sync 
: 
.B 'a event -> 'a
.sp
``Synchronize\&'\&' on an event: offer all the communication
possibilities specified in the event to the outside world,
and block until one of the communications succeed\&. The result
value of that communication is returned\&.

.sp

.I val select 
: 
.B 'a event list -> 'a
.sp
``Synchronize\&'\&' on an alternative of events\&.
.B select evl
is shorthand for 
.B sync(choose evl)
\&.

.sp

.I val poll 
: 
.B 'a event -> 'a option
.sp
Non\-blocking version of 
.B Event\&.sync
: offer all the communication
possibilities specified in the event to the outside world,
and if one can take place immediately, perform it and return
.B Some r
where 
.B r
is the result value of that communication\&.
Otherwise, return 
.B None
without blocking\&.
